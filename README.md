# Tardis

So Quirky G and I are driving down the road with the kids in the back, just chatting about stuff.  On this particular day, we were discussing getting a new vehicle:

&nbsp;&nbsp;_QG: I'd really like to get a new car._  
&nbsp;&nbsp;_S: What are you thinking about?_  
&nbsp;&nbsp;_QG: A highlander but I don't think we should spend the money right now._  
&nbsp;&nbsp;_S: You don't you like this van?_  
&nbsp;&nbsp;_QG: I hate it!_  
&nbsp;&nbsp;_S: Well, it's TARDIS blue._  
&nbsp;&nbsp;_QG: I'd totally drive it if it looked like a TARDIS!_  
&nbsp;&nbsp;_S: Does it need to have a flashing lighting and make that sound?_  
&nbsp;&nbsp;_QC: Why wouldn't it?_  
&nbsp;&nbsp;_S: I can do that._  

And so this project was born: Make the van look like a TARDIS.
